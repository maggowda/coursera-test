		<div>This classic chicken alfredo is just that. It’s a family-friendly recipe that has stood the test of time.It’s such a loved dish because of its rich cream and butter-based sauce and all that flavorful parmesan to make it so crave-able. And the addition of browned chicken adds another layer of flavor and texture to it.Alfredo sauce and chicken were just made to go together. It’s such a simple yet delicious pairing.</div>

		<div>Beef Wellington</div>
		<div>Beef Wellington originated in France and is the main dish. It’s an elegant and decadent meal that we like to save for special occasions. Beef Wellington is a nice cut of meat, usually a fillet steak, beef tenderloin, or filet mignon. It uses the center-cut portion of the meat that is known to be the most tender and juicy part of the cow. The meat is wrapped in a mustard sauce, then a mushroom duxelles and prosciutto. Then, it’s all wrapped in a puff pastry and baked until golden brown.</div>

		<div>Sushi</div>
		<div>Sushi is a Japanese dish featuring specially prepared rice and usually some type of fish or seafood, often raw, but sometimes cooked. And though you might automatically associate the word sushi with raw fish, it's actually the rice that is the most important ingredient. Indeed, the word "sushi" refers to the sour flavor of the vinegared rice.</div>
